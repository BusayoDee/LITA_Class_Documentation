### Project Title: Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
The data analysis project aims to generate insights into the performance of an IT STORE that specializes in the sale of Printer and Copier parts over a given period. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insights to make reasonable decisions which then enables us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to kow the best performance from our data.

### Data Sources
The Primary source of data used here is data sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or any other data repository site.
